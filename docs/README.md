# GobchatEx

A Dalamud plugin for Final Fantasy XIV via [XIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher).

## What it does

**RP highlighting** in the native chat log, for roleplayers: chat messages
in configured channels are recolored per segment —

- **Say** — quoted speech: `"…"`, `„…“`, `„…”`, `“…”`, `»…«`, `«…»`
- **Emote** — actions: `*…*`, `<…>`
- **OOC** — out-of-character: `((…))`
- **Mentions** — your own list of trigger words (case-insensitive whole
  words) plus per-character player-name matching: full/first/last name,
  opt-in partial (substring) matching, Miqo'te apostrophe segments, and
  typo-tolerant fuzzy matching with three strictness levels. Decorative
  "fancy font" text is unicode-folded before matching. Optionally plays a
  game sound effect (`<se.1>`–`<se.16>`) with a per-sound cooldown.

Colors come from the game's UIColor palette (swatch picker in the config
window; right-click a swatch to clear). Delimiters may span item/player
links; an unclosed delimiter colors to the end of the message (matching the
original [GobchatEx](https://github.com/Shuro/GobchatEx) overlay's rules).
The message-rewriting approach follows
[ChatAlerts](https://github.com/Ottermandias/ChatAlerts). Design decisions
are recorded in [adr/](adr/); planned features migrating from the
standalone app are sequenced in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

**Player groups** recolor chat sender names per group: custom groups you
fill via right-click → Groups on any player name (also inside
[Chat 2](https://github.com/Infiziert90/ChatTwo)'s own context menu), the
`/gobchat group` command, or the settings tab — plus the game's seven
friend-list display groups (Star–Club). Custom groups take precedence over
friend groups. The settings window itself is localized (English, German)
and follows Dalamud's language unless overridden.

## Commands

- `/gobchat` — Toggles the settings window (also reachable via
  `/xlplugins` → GobchatEx → ⚙, or the gear in the title bar).
- `/gobchatex`, `/gex` — Aliases for `/gobchat`.
- `/gobchat group list` — Prints your custom groups with their indices.
- `/gobchat group <n|name> <add|remove> Player Name [World]` — Adds or
  removes a player from the custom group with 1-based index `n` or the
  given name; the bracketed world is optional (a bare entry matches the
  name on any world). `... clear` empties the group; `g` is a shorthand
  for `group`.

## Building locally

This project uses the `Dalamud.NET.Sdk`, which auto-references everything
needed (`Dalamud.dll`, `DalamudPackager`, `Dalamud.Bindings.ImGui`,
`FFXIVClientStructs`, `Lumina`, `InteropGenerator.Runtime`).

```sh
dotnet build
```

That produces `bin/x64/Debug/GobchatEx/` — a packed plugin folder, not
just a DLL. To load it in-game:

1. `/xlsettings` → Experimental → "Dev Plugin Locations" → add the full path
   to `GobchatEx.dll` inside that folder.
2. `/xlplugins` → Dev Tools → Installed Dev Plugins → enable.
3. While iterating, enable **Automatic Reloading** on the plugin's row
   under Installed Dev Plugins — Dalamud then reloads the plugin whenever
   `dotnet build` rewrites the DLL.

## Testing

The matching engine (`GobchatEx/Core/`) and the localization helper
(`GobchatEx/Localization/`) are Dalamud-free and covered by unit tests (no
game or XIVLauncher install needed):

```sh
dotnet test
# with coverage:
dotnet test --collect "Code Coverage;Format=cobertura"
```

Manual in-game smoke test (the Dalamud-facing layer is thin and validated
by hand). Setup: the **Echo** channel is *not* highlighted by default
(defaults: Say, Custom Emote, Party, Cross-world Party) — tick it in the
highlighted-channels list first, and add a mention trigger word. Then:

1. `/echo he said "hi" and *waves* ((brb)) YourTriggerWord` — expect the
   emote, OOC and mention segments to recolor. The default Say color is
   white (UIColor row 1), so quotes only stand out in channels whose base
   color isn't white.
2. Repeat with an item link (Ctrl-click an item into the message) inside the
   quotes — the link keeps working and the quote color resumes after it.
3. Send the line twice — the next chat line must render in normal colors
   (balanced color payloads).
4. Add a trigger word, enable the mention sound, have someone (or an alt)
   say it — sound plays, respecting cooldown and the "not for my own
   messages" toggle.
5. Mentions tab → "Add Current Character" (it starts active), then
   `/echo Yourfirstname likes this` — your name recolors as a mention.
6. Right-click a player name in the chat log → Groups → add them to a
   custom group that has a color — their sender name recolors on their
   next chat line (group coloring skips Tell/Echo/Error, so use Say or
   Party).
7. Rebuild (auto-reload) or toggle the plugin off and on — settings
   persist.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome — development setup, commands, and the PR checklist
are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). If a PR involves AI assistance beyond autocomplete,
disclose it in the PR description using the official Dalamud AI policy's
levels ([dalamud.dev/plugin-publishing/ai-policy](https://dalamud.dev/plugin-publishing/ai-policy)):

- **None/Hint** — no AI, or autocomplete only. No disclosure needed.
- **Assist** — human-led; AI used for specific tasks on demand.
- **Pair** — active collaboration; roughly equal contribution.
- **Copilot** — AI implements; human plans and reviews.
- **Auto** — AI acts autonomously with minimal human direction.

Test your changes yourself and be able to explain what they do — "the AI
did it" isn't an acceptable answer during review. The official Dalamud
plugin repository ([DalamudPluginsD17](https://github.com/goatcorp/DalamudPluginsD17))
auto-rejects entirely AI-generated submissions and bans undisclosed AI use
in demonstrably AI-written work. See [AI-DISCLOSURE.md](AI-DISCLOSURE.md)
for this project's own AI-usage history.
